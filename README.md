# Web Chat Application 
A simple Chat Application Clone made using [React.js](https://react.dev/) ⚡

Currently, I have implemented the basic UI with Firebase commands .


Deployed it using cloudflare [here](https://web-chat-free.pages.dev/).

## Running the project
This is a [React.js](https://react.dev/) project created with [`npx create-react-app my-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-react-app).
After installation `cd my-app`.

In the project directory, you can run:
